# Student_Connect

## Description

Welcome to the Student Connect project! This is a video chat system that enables students of a specific university to connect with one another virtually as they would do so on-campus.
Students will get an opportunity to interact with one another through the use of this medium that is close to realism as the main goal of this system is to mimic the interaction that students possibly have with one another into an online environment.
